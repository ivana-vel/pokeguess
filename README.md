# PokeGuess
A simple game of guessing Pokemons! You have 60 seconds to guess the names of 10 Pokemons, all from generation 1. Write the name of the pokemon into the designated space and submit by pressing Enter on your keyboard. If you don't know the name of the pokemon, you can skip it by clicking on the right arrow or using the right arrow on your keyboard. Left arrow is for going back, and after each game your stats from the round are revealed (how many you guessed right, what where the names of pokemon you didn't know, how much time you had left).
